# InfiniteAdder Chrome Extension

This is a chrome extension that allows the user to enter two item names, which will in turn be sent to the infinitecraft api and the result of their combination will be added to the item list in the website.

## 4. Updating the Extension

- To update, repeat the download + unzip process.
- Then, in `chrome://extensions/`, click **Reload** under your extension.

## Notes

- The folder must contain a `manifest.json` file. Without it, Chrome won’t recognize it as an extension.
- Make sure the folder structure is correct (the `manifest.json` should be at the root of the folder you load).
